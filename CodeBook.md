<h1>Code Book</h1><h2>Class Variables</h2><p> Class variables contain indentifying information such asActivity ID, SubjectID, and Activity Name. In the datasets, they appear as"activityID", "subID", and "activityName"</p><h2>Measurement Variables</h2><p> The measurements taken for each subject for each activity.<strong><em>features_info.txt</em><strong> contains detailed descriptionthe variables.</p><h2>Data Transformations</h2><h3>Column Headers</h3><p> The original files do not contain column headers. Hence, colnames functionin R was used to assign column headers with meaningful nameswithin the context of the data files and data descriptions </p><h3>Removal of Columns</h3><p> Course Project instruction calls for columns with "mean" or "std" information.Hence, all columns that do not contain such information were removed.<h3>Data Merge</h3><p> Course Project instruction calls for two tidy datasets withextraneous information removed. Once the above data transformationsteps were completed, the data groups were combined to create onefull dataset and a summary dataset that contains means of each featureby activity name and subject ID. </p>
